This work achieved several significant milestones in the numerical computation of hydrogen wavefunctions using the finite difference method (FDM). Three Laplace operators were successfully implemented using 7-point, 19-point, and 27-point stencils. These implementations provided accurate approximations of the Laplacian. The best results were achieved using a 19-point stencil.

The trial \textit{ansatz} for the hydrogen wavefunction, as described in Kołos' book, was discretized and implemented as CuPy functions. A dedicated goal function class was developed to describe and evaluate the state of the wavefunction, providing the foundation for optimization algorithms. The correctness of this implementation was validated using the trial \textit{ansatz}.

Two optimization algorithms, gradient descent, and Adam, were implemented to minimize Rayleigh's quotient and determine the ground state energy. Both algorithms were tested and confirmed to produce correct results using the trial \textit{ansatz}. Ground state energies were successfully obtained using random initial wavefunctions. For low learning rates, gradient descent proved to be more precise than Adam in calculating hydrogen ground energy, but for a price of lengthier convergence. Adam provided fastest convergence of hydrogen ground state. Adam reproduced the expected results of excited states of hydrogen, but it was prone to oscillations and required significantly more computational time than LOBPCG. Wavefunctions obtained with Adam showed significant deformations. First twelve hydrogen energies were calculated using LOBPCG.

\subsection{Conclusions and implications}

%- the implementations proved the theory was correct
%
%- finite difference method is well enough method for approximating Laplacian part of hamiltonian operator, to calculate the hydrogen states properly
%
%- current customer graphics card are capable not only of small educational tasks, such as Schr{\"o}dinger equation in 2D, but also bigger 3D systems, such as atom states
%
%- the calculations were done simultaneously on 12 wave functions each discretized on a cube with 80 bohr radius edge length. This means that systems of size about ~1000 bohr radius, or 51nm can be modelled using the same method and hardware.

The outcomes of this study validate the theoretical basis for using FDM to approximate the Laplacian in quantum mechanical problems. The method accurately modeled the hydrogen wavefunction and its energy states, demonstrating the viability of GPU-based computations for solving Schrödinger's equation in 3D systems.

\subsection{Future work}

%- the hyperparameters of Adam require refining, and the algorithm itself might be improved
%
%- the PGD method might be a better solution than Adam, if the problems with implementation are overcomed
%
%- the goal function class might benefit from caching the results, thus reducing numerical complexity
%
%method can be further developed by:
%
%- adding a UI that is consistent with existing quantum chemistry packages
%
%- adding options as external potential
%
%- hamiltonian has to be checked for potential of optimization, especially space complexity
%
%- a C++/C CUDA implementation might provide even better results, especially the ability to decide when the memory is freed
%
%- current computers frequently have bigger RAM than GPU's VRAM, as well as faster than ever SSDs - there might be a space for improvement by storing some of the data on either of those spaces
%
%- calculations of helium atom and hydrogen molecule should be next steps in development of FDM methods for quantum chemistry
The Adam optimizer, while functional, requires hyperparameter refinement to improve its efficiency and stability. Further improvements to the algorithm, especially convergence checks, may reduce its susceptibility to oscillations. Additionally, implementing a Perturbed Gradient Descent algorithm could make it a viable alternative to Adam, particularly for systems requiring higher numerical stability.

The goal function class could benefit from caching intermediate results, reducing numerical complexity and improving performance. Furthermore, integrating a user interface aligned with existing quantum chemistry packages would enhance usability. Adding features such as external potential options and optimizing the Hamiltonian's space complexity could make the framework more versatile and efficient.

A dedicated C++/CUDA implementation may enhance performance by providing more control over memory management. Given the disparity between system RAM and GPU VRAM in modern computers and the increasing speed of SSDs, storing intermediate data in these memory spaces could improve scalability and efficiency.

Finally, extending this method to more complex systems, such as the helium atom and the hydrogen molecule, is a natural progression. These steps would deepen FDM's applicability in quantum chemistry and expand its role in computational physics research.
